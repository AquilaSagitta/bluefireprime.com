			<p>Presumably you are looking at our corp description because you want to know who the F*ck Blue-Fire is or what the F*ck we do. Well let me fill you in...</p>

			<p>Blue-Fire plays EVE exclusively in BOSS-Mode. We do everything you do, but better. This is not up for debate, it is a FACT. We blow shit up, we welp fleets,

			we make fun of people who just destroyed our entire fleet...because we didn't want those ships anyway. We troll the shit out of local chat, alliance chat,

			intel chat, corp chat, and we even troll ourselves in private chat. We pillage wormholes, rape carebears, and their mum's. We do all this better than you do.

			One of our core values as a corp is saving white women, and we do it all day. Blue-Fire drops outposts, just to name them after Leon's Mum. We steal shit, awox,

			and then save more white women. Again, we are still doing all of this stuff better than you. </p>

			<p>Are you interested in joining our super-exclusive-boss-mode-eve-winning-white-women-saving-epic-trolling-welptastic-club? Too bad, you suck at this game and

			we hate you. Regardless, join our public chat "Blue-Fire" and we'll discuss how bad you are and the quickest way to quit EVE. </p>
